#  Hi, I’m Vaishnavi Ramesh!

I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at **Arizona State University**, with a background in commerce and over **2 years of experience in digital marketing**. I’ve worked across diverse roles — from **campaign execution and social media** to **performance marketing and CRM implementation**.

Most recently, I worked with **Tamara Leisure Experiences**, a hospitality brand with resorts across South India, where I was responsible for **ad optimization, campaign reporting**, and implementing **Salesforce Marketing Cloud** to map end-to-end customer journeys. That’s where I discovered my passion for **data-driven marketing and behavioral insights**.

##  What Drives Me
I’m deeply curious about how **data, marketing, and human behavior** intersect. Whether it’s optimizing a campaign, analyzing review sentiment, or designing a customer journey — I enjoy uncovering the *“why”* behind every metric and turning it into actionable insight.
